## Overview

clipkeeper runs in the background and automatically captures everything you copy to your clipboard. It stores your clipboard history locally with intelligent content classification and privacy filtering, making it easy to find and reuse previously copied content.

## Features

**Currently Available:**
- **Background Monitoring** - Automatically captures all clipboard activity
- **Local Storage** - All data stored in SQLite on your machine
- **Content Classification** - Automatically detects content types (text, code, URLs, JSON, XML, markdown, etc.)
- **Privacy Filtering** - Automatically blocks passwords, credit cards, API keys, SSH keys
- **Text Search** - Search clipboard history with keywords and filters
- **Copy History** - Copy previous clipboard entries back to clipboard
- **Auto Retention** - Automatically clean up old entries based on retention policy
- **List & Filter** - View history with filtering by content type, date, and text
- **Configuration** - Customize retention period, poll interval, and privacy settings
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Planned Features:**
- Semantic search with natural language queries
- LLM embedding integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Vector similarity search

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g clipkeeper
```

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Background Service

```bash
clipkeeper start
```

The service will run in the background and monitor your clipboard automatically.

### 2. Copy Some Content

Copy anything to your clipboard - text, code, URLs, etc. clipkeeper captures it all!

### 3. View Your History

```bash
# List last 10 entries
clipkeeper list

# List last 50 entries
clipkeeper list --limit 50

# Filter by content type
clipkeeper list --type url
clipkeeper list --type code
clipkeeper list --type json

# Search clipboard history
clipkeeper search "error message"
clipkeeper search "function" --type code
clipkeeper search "https" --limit 20

# Filter by date
clipkeeper list --since 2024-01-01
clipkeeper list --since yesterday
clipkeeper list --since "10 days ago"
```

Available content types: `text`, `code`, `url`, `json`, `xml`, `markdown`, `file_path`, `image`

### 4. Copy Previous Entries

```bash
# List entries with IDs
clipkeeper list

# Copy an entry back to clipboard by ID
clipkeeper copy <entry-id>
```

### 5. Check Service Status

```bash
clipkeeper status
```

Shows service status, uptime, total entries, and breakdown by content type.

### 6. Stop the Service

```bash
clipkeeper stop
```

| `clipkeeper config set <key> <value>` | Set a configuration value |

## Configuration

clipkeeper stores configuration in:
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\clipkeeper\config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/clipkeeper/config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/clipkeeper/config.json`

### Common Settings

```bash
# Set retention period (days)
clipkeeper config set retention.days 60

# Adjust clipboard polling interval (milliseconds)
clipkeeper config set monitoring.pollInterval 500

# Enable/disable privacy filtering
clipkeeper config set privacy.enabled true
```

### Configuration Keys

|-----|-------------|---------|
| `retention.days` | Days to keep history (0 = unlimited) | 30 |
| `monitoring.pollInterval` | Clipboard check interval (ms) | 500 |
| `privacy.enabled` | Enable privacy filtering | true |

Retention cleanup runs automatically every hour when the service is running.

## Privacy & Security

clipkeeper is designed with privacy as a priority:

- **All data stays local** - Nothing is sent to external services
- **Automatic filtering** - Sensitive content is blocked by default:
  - Passwords (8+ chars with mixed case, numbers, symbols)
  - Credit card numbers (validated with Luhn algorithm)
  - API keys (Bearer tokens, sk-* keys)
  - Private keys (PEM format)
  - SSH keys (RSA, Ed25519)
- **Secure storage** - Config files have restricted permissions
- **Configurable** - Customize privacy settings and add custom patterns

### Data Storage Locations

**Clipboard History:**
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\clipkeeper\clipboard-history.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/clipkeeper/clipboard-history.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/clipkeeper/clipboard-history.db`

**Logs:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\clipkeeper\clipkeeper.log`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/clipkeeper/clipkeeper.log`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/clipkeeper/clipkeeper.log`

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start monitoring
clipkeeper start

# Copy some text, code, URLs...
# (clipkeeper captures everything automatically)

# View your history
clipkeeper list

# Search for specific content
clipkeeper search "error"
clipkeeper search "function" --type code

# Copy a previous entry back to clipboard
clipkeeper list  # Note the entry ID
clipkeeper copy abc123

# View only URLs you've copied
clipkeeper list --type url --limit 20

# View entries from the last week
clipkeeper list --since "7 days ago"

# View entries from the last 10 days
clipkeeper list --since "10 days ago"

# Export history as JSON
clipkeeper list --format json > history.json

# Clear old entries
clipkeeper clear

# Stop when done
clipkeeper stop
```

### Search Examples

```bash
# Simple text search
clipkeeper search "password reset"

# Search with type filter
clipkeeper search "import" --type code

# Search with date filter
clipkeeper search "meeting" --since yesterday

# Search with result limit
clipkeeper search "http" --limit 5
```

### Configuration Examples

```bash
# Keep history for 90 days
clipkeeper config set retention.days 90

# Check current retention setting
clipkeeper config get retention.days

# View all settings
clipkeeper config show
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

```bash
# Check if already running
clipkeeper status

# Check logs
# Windows: %APPDATA%\clipkeeper\clipkeeper.log
# macOS/Linux: ~/Library/Application Support/clipkeeper/clipkeeper.log
```

### No entries showing up

1. Make sure the service is running: `clipkeeper status`
2. Copy something to your clipboard
3. Wait a moment (default poll interval is 500ms)
4. Try `clipkeeper list` again

### Permission errors

- **Windows:** May need to run as Administrator
- **macOS/Linux:** Check file permissions in data directory

### Some clipboard content not captured

- Browser clipboard operations may temporarily lock the clipboard
- The service retries once after 100ms
- Most content will be captured on the next poll

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clipkeeper.git
cd clipkeeper

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Test CLI locally
node src/cli.js start
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Currently: **242 out of 244 tests passing** (2 skipped)

## Architecture

clipkeeper consists of several key components:

- **ClipboardMonitor** - Polls system clipboard for changes with retry logic
- **HistoryStore** - SQLite database for clipboard entries with metadata
- **PrivacyFilter** - Detects and filters sensitive content patterns
- **ContentClassifier** - Identifies content types using heuristics
- **ConfigurationManager** - Manages settings with validation
- **ServiceManager** - Background service lifecycle management
- **CLI** - Command-line interface using Commander.js
